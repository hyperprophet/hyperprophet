HyperProphet is a library to compute thousands of time-series forecasts concurrently using [Facebook's Prophet][prophet] library. The computation happens in the cloud using the [HyperProphet service][hp].

The key features are:

* **Fast**: computes thousands of forecasts in minutes
* **Easy**: switch from Prophet to HyperProphet by changing couple of lines of code
* **Productive**: experiment with forecasts in your notebooks without worrying about infrastructure
